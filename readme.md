# Boids

This project was inspired by a recent visit to an art museum and a video of a cat of all things. At the museum, there was a projected display of some birds on the ground and when you would move your hand across it, the birds would fly away from your hand. The same was true for the video of the cat. After seeing this, I wanted to make my own version of this with a spare projector that I had laying around.

The start of this project was to first discover what this was called. I found that this was similar or exactly the same as the Boids that Craig Reynolds was talking about. After reading his paper I also came across a paper from Conrad Parker. This went over the psuedo-code and vector math that was needed to make this possible. After that I had everything that I needed to get started.
